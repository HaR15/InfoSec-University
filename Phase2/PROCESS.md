We focused on displaying the information for the user however left out the admin's ability to input/update this information. As a result, we encountered difficulties when trying to initiate objects without a universal standard as to what format to use. This problem was discovered too late to be remedied in the first sprint. Ideally, we would prefer to have built a CMS for the admin to add and manipulate tutorial and excercise content. We would then use this content in populating the rest of the website. Currently, we had to make numerous make-shift temporary forms or directly manipulate the database to include the necassary information for our minimum viable product. This increased our net development time unnecassarily. This problem occured because we had not realized that the functionality of adding/updating content would be highly beneficial when making user stories. Since no user story was made, it was subsequently not included in the release plan at any stage. An important decision was to add a mini-cms into this phase that we can extend into the next development cycle.
