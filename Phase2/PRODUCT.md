Our product is a web application that allows users to learn web and computer security in a strucutre and productve manner.  This is done through the design of the site and how the material is presented.  The design is bright and easy-to-navigate to encourage and facilitate learning.  This design choice is unique as other similar sites we have seen are usually dark and we feel doesn't help learn.  The material learned through our site is doing mostly through exercises.  The exercises are easily navigated to through the home page and are organized by the topic.  This allows the user to control what they want to learn and how fast they would like to learn the material.  Within each exercise, a user can see the title of the exercise along with a description to give a background of exercise they selected.  They are then asked to perform a task that they should be able to complete using the information within the exercise.  When the user is happy with an answer they type inside the console provided, they can submit their answer and will then get a confirmation if they passed or failed the task.
