	<h1>Guide</h1>
	<p>Infosec University is committed to teaching common security vulnerabilities to anyone with sufficient programming experience. For each vulnerability, a background description is given as an overview of what the vulnerability is, an example of how the vulnerability can be exploited, and a list of tutorials that can be explored to gain further understanding into an area of the vulnerability. For each tutorial, a brief description is given followed by a link to the exercises for this specific topic of a vulnerability. Users can choose which interactive exercise to do from the exercises list. Each interactive exercise provides a short demo, followed by instructions for the exericse. Instructions could require copying and pasting a piece of code to break the mock system, checking the page source to find a segment of code containing crucial information, or more challenging problems requiring more thought. 

  To keep track of your progress for completed exercises, a registered user will have to be logged in. Without an account, tutorials and exercises are allowed to be viewed but progress will not be tracked.
