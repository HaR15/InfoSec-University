# Phase 1 Comments
* User stories lack implication of feature to be implemented.
  * Ex. As a user, I want this site to solve problems VS.  As a user, I want push notification for something.
* MVP desciption was decent, but lacked a unique feeature that meant to stand out from the other sites we evaluated
* TA said it was fine to take test materials from the other sites, but there needs to be something we add onto it so it is just not copying and pasting.
* Release planning is too small and/or too general.  Need to rewrite and show to him next tutorial what the 4 week plan.
* For Phase 2, we have to keep up a weekly log detailing what each person is assigned to do in the upcoming week and what they completed during the previous week.

TA mentioned that Phase 1 marks are ok.  He had to deduct marks but not too many for us to be too concerned.   He is also worried that not everyone is on the same page for the project and that might contriubte to the lack of commitment towards features we are implementing.
