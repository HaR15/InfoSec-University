## Introduction

__Zhi Hao (David) Chen__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student looking to finish at the end of the term.  I have some web programming experience from projects I have done for school.  In my spare time I enjoy playing all sorts of games with my friends, but recently I am trying to do some side projects for fun.

__Alexei Darmin__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student aiming to graduate in 2016.  I've been a part-time Front-End web developer for two years and my goal is to either become a full stack web developer or to specialize in front-end once I graduate. My time is usually split between school, work, friends and sports. Primarily soccer for the UTSC team, ice skating, and table tennis.

__Eric Scott__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student completing my final semester.  I took last year off to do a 16 month internship at IBM for the WebSphere Commerce team doing product support, tool development, client enablement, and client education. I currently work there part time during the school year, returning for full time work starting May 1st. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games, hockey, and going snowboarding.  

__Lucas Lima__  
I am an international CS student. I have some experience in Web Development and I have written and collaborated on articles for IBM Developer Works ([Article 1](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-blograils-app/index.html), [Article 2](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/dm-1408-arduino-iot-app/index.html), [Article 3](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/analytics/library/ba-muse-toycar-app/index.html)), having one of them in the [Top 15 Bluemix tutorials in 2014](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-bestoflbluemix2014/index.html). I have also presented in some Toronto SMAC meetups. In my spare time I like playing drums and occasionally engaging in some cool tech projects. 

__Haris Shoaib__
I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist, hoping to graduate in 2017. Currently, I am also a part-time Jr. Web developer student at OISE. I usually work about 5-7 hours a week, on a time that fits in my schedule. At work, I help my supervisor in completing small, independent tasks, which also helps me learn about the basics of front and back end web development at a manageable pace. Although, at the moment my strengths lie in Front-end Web development, I hope to be proficient in working with the full stack. In my spare time, I like to read tech articles such as on HackerNews, play basketball, or go out with my friends.
