## Introduction

__Zhi Hao (David) Chen__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student looking to finish at the end of the term.  I have some web programming experience from projects I have done for school.  In my spare time I enjoy playing all sorts of games with my friends, but recently I am trying to do some side projects for fun.

__Alexei Darmin__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student aiming to graduate in 2016.  I've been a part-time Front-End web developer for two years and my goal is to either become a full stack web developer or to specialize in front-end once I graduate. My time is usually split between school, work, friends and sports. Primarily soccer for the UTSC team, ice skating, and table tennis.

I am a 4th year CS student completing my final semester.  I took last year off to do a 16 month internship at IBM for the WebSphere Commerce team doing product support, tool development, client enablement, and client education. I currently work there part time during the school year, returning for full time work starting May 1st. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games, hockey, and going snowboarding.
