## Introduction

__Zhi Hao (David) Chen__<br />
I am a 4th year CS student looking to finish at the end of the term.  I have some web programming experience from projects I have done for school.  In my spare time I enjoy playing all sorts of games with my friends, but recently I am trying to do some side projects for fun.

I am a 4th year CS student aiming to graduate in 2016.  I've been a part-time Front-End web developer for two years and my goal is to either become a full stack web developer or to specialize in front-end once I graduate. My time is usually split between school, work, friends and sports. Primarily soccer for the UTSC team, ice skating, and table tennis.
