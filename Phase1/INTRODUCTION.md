## Introduction

The project that we have chosen to implement is a computer security tutorial application. This application will help users learn computer security principles, test their understanding through exercises, and keep them informed about computer security news. We chose this project because there is quite a large variety of applications for learning about programming, but there aren't very many places to learn about computer security. The places that do exist for learning computer security suffer from issues such as poor UI, poor tutorial/exercise categorization, poor/minimal explanation of computer security principles or attack techniques, etc. To decide on a project, we each first came up with a possible project to implement. Once we had a selection of possible projects, we reviewed each possible project and decided how feasible it would be based on factors such as knowledge of the project's subject matter, personal interest, amount of content already available for subject matter, etc. After taking these factors into consideration, as well as the professor deciding the security application being the most interesting, we decided to implement the computer security tutorial application.
