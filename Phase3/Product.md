<h3>Product Highlights :</h3>

 * Infosec University is a website focused on teaching computer security for developers . The idea is to have an organized and good looking website that contains several courses about security , such as SQL Injection , Cryptography, etc . However, Infosec  doesnâ€™t focus only in understanding the problem, it also teach the user how to exploit and prevent such breaches  .

<h3>The major product decisions that differentiate our project from others include :</h3>

 * A well planned design, differentiated from all the others websites that just look sloppy.
 * Proper content organization ,  we separated the content in a way that the user will be more comfortable while others websites just throw content after content .
 * Accessibility, our website is designed to be a easy way to enter the security topic.

<h3>Features that we focused on:</h3>
 * The design of our project was a big part of it , because most websites tend to be confusing .
 *	The tutorials is a important part of the project, our focus is not only to teach the user how to use an exploit, but also to help him understand more about it.
 *	The exercises is a decisive feature, is what a user want to see in a website like this .

<h3>Features that we postponed:</h3>

  * We postponed the chat for future releases, its a feature that for now is not important, but might be in the future.
 	* We also postponed the challanges, since the most important part is the exercises and tutorials.

<h3>Typical uses of the product :</h3>
