<h3>Application Architecture</h3>

* __Webserver__: Sails.js provides tools for building fast and scalable applications with Node.js. Entirely built in JavaScript, these technologies allow our team to use only one programming language in our Stack.
* __Database__: MongoDB is fast, scalable and easy to manipulate and integrate.  

<h3>Implementation Patterns</h3>

* __SOAP__ - Implemented in some Modules.
* __REST__ - Implemented in External and Internal APIs to manipulate data.
* __MVC__ - Modules and services are built on top of a Model-View-Controller architecture.

<h3>Significant Architecture decisions</h3>

* __MVC__: MVC pattern could improve the design of modules and services.
  * The use of MVC was essencial when assigning tasks and also helped the development team design robust modules that could be easily integrated and modifield. 
* __NoSQL__: NoSQL database could provide better data manipulation and itegration.
  * The use of a NoSQL provided easy manipulation of data in our application and was significant in the development workflow. Throughout the application development, by using MongoDB the team was capable of easily changing the design of the database, and also had remote work improved (remote database made the data available to all developers).
