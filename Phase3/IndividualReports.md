  <li>
    During the last phase I was responsible for these two User Stories:<br>
    -As Sergina I want to review Cryptography so that I understand how it works.<br>
    -As Sergina I want to practice using Cryptography so that I can test my understanding.<br>
    Based on the material outlined in the last phase I created the tutorials and exercises within the category Cryptography.
  </li>
  <li>
    For this project we used the framework <a href= "http://sailsjs.org/#!/">Sails.js</a> which I haven't used before. It was very interesting learning about the framework and seeing how useful it is.
  </li>
  <li> 
  I am responsible with the work - I tried to plan ahead, and I finished my parts of the work as soon as possible.
  </li>
  <li> I fell that I could be more proactive.</li>

        Most significant contribution - exercise content:

            <li><a href="https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/302W15-Prj-Team12-repo/commit/96d8eed157f121d9c47f96f23533a484f242358e">Sessions</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/302W15-Prj-Team12-repo/commit/3c7efc7283796d6ff63f0d6eab3a2c2d14546267">Screenshots for exercises to show in preview window, based on progress in the exercise (before completion, after successful submission, and after incorrect submission)</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Concept learned - Learned how to manipulate Javascript on page to take the JSON data, iterate through its contents to display results on the page. This concept was useful for displaying completed exercises on the profile page, as well as displaying content (such as news articles) in a specific format.
    </li>
    <li>
        Strengths - In-depth security knowledge was used to explain how exercises and tutorials should be implemented. For example, using SQL Injection on a login page, breaking password encryption for passwords stored in etc/passwd file. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Weaknesses - Workload management. While waiting on work that requires other group members to complete something first, I should complete other work in the meantime that does not require prerequisite work to completed first. This way, I will be able to complete my total work much faster.

<h3>Haris Shoaib (HaR15)</h3>  

* My most significant contribution was implementing the <a href="https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/302W15-Prj-Team12-repo/commit/81cf4301fad7ccd6bca0de8b5919b6d5ad2529">categoryEditor, tutorialEditor, and exerciseEditor for the AdminController</a>
* I learned how to write actions in a Sails.js controller. <a href="https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/302W15-Prj-Team12-repo/commit/554f6b425e972bee14d94e1c94ccd85bcf7554f6">For example querying a model and sending that returned object to a view.</a>
* My main strength as a team member is keeping team members on task and making sure that our team is fulfilling our requirements for a phase. Also, I am at most group meetings and take an active part in the discussions. 
* I think I can improve in learning about a new framework, such as Sails.js, by carefully studying the documentation instead of getting help most of the time from a team member.

  </li>
  <li>Concepts learned - I improved my knowledge of Javascript, for example, I learned how to use regular expressions. (<a href="https://github.com/UoT-CSC30x-W15/302W15-Prj-Team12-repo/blob/Phase3/Phase2/PRODUCT.md">Phase 2 Product.md</a>)</li>
  <li>Strengths - I was always helping team members - As I had more experience with our Stack (Sails.js and MongoDB), I helped other teammates set up their development environment, as well as helped with concepts and tips of how to work on our Stack. </li>
  <li>Weaknesses - I sometimes cross limits while helping teammates, taking work that Iâ€™m not responsible for.</li>
